This is the project we have been working on in class
in preparations for our mini app and getting the class started.

Side notes:
Anytime you start back up, remember that part of the cluster url changes (the part after cluster0). This would be in the env file. You will need to redo these things if starting fresh:
- npm i express
- add an env file. you can find what to put in at Render > Enviroment. You will do MONGO_URI = "the link w/o the quotations." Additionally, the change will be found in Atlas when you go to reconnect.
